# ExoCharacterLoader
Mod for I Was a Teenage Exocolonist that makes adding custom characters easier.

Uses BepInEx to inject the code (included in the releases)

Currently only adds a way to add a character to the the same extent as was already possible by modifying the Chara.tsv file.

# Installation

Just put the contents of the Exocolonist folder in the release zip into your Exocolonist game folder, and launch the game.

# Adding a character

Also included in the release is a CustomCharacters folder with a CharacterTemplate folder in it. Put the CustomCharacters into the Exocolonist folder and rename CharacterTemplate to your character's name, and modify the data.json file (the sprites folder is currently useless).
Any folder in CustomCharacters with a proper data.json file in it will add a character to the game's list.
